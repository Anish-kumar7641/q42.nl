        </a>

        <p>At Q42 we love <a href="http://meteor.com">Meteor</a>.
					In fact, we were early adopters of the platform in 2012 when we ported
					this website from .NET to Meteor, and our interaction engineer Rahul
					became a recognised "Meteor Captain" when he started
					<a href="http://meetup.com/meteor-nl">organising Meteor meetups</a>
					at our offices:</p>

        <ul>
					<li><a href="http://meetup.com/meteor-south-bay">Meteor South Bay</a></li>
          <li><a href="http://meetup.com/meteor-nl">Meteor NL</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Since then, we've continued exploring and it's become one of our
					go-to platforms for internal apps and <a href="https://q42.com/jumpstarts">jumpstarts</a>.
					We've started building client projects with Meteor and are now even running a
					startup on it. See below for a quick overview of what we've built so far.</p>

        <p>Interested in talking to us about a Meteor project? Get in touch with
					<a href="mailto:rahul@q42.com">Rahul</a> or

				<h2>Mazda Car Configurator</h2>
				<p>Most car configurators: lots of screens, buttons,
					jargon and configuration. The configurator we built for Mazda with
					Meteor and React: easy to understand, responsive, and beautiful.</p>
				<p>Building this configurator was so challenging, we dedicated an entire
					Meteor meetup to explaining the various technical intricacies of it,
					and even created a new package for Meteor to improve React performance.</p>

					<p>The team that worked on the Mazda Car Configurator wracked they brains

					a Meteor package that makes working with complex trees in React painless.</p>

				<h2>Meteor in Flip Flops</h2>
				<p>In late 2015, Rahul and Lukas were approached by Maciej Novakovski with a crazy request:
					Maciej wanted to get better at Meteor, but he wanted to do it in the sun. So he suggested
					flying out to Las Palmas, Gran Canaria, and hosting a workshop there!</p>
				<p>Rahul and Lukas were skeptical that it would work, but Maciej managed to sell 15 tickets
					to folks from all over Europe, and so in late February 2016, they got on a plane and spent
					a week in the sun teaching Meteor and surfing at <a href="http://meteorinflipflops.com">Meteor in Flip Flops</a>.
					For work. One of those once in a lifetime experiences that makes us get up in the morning.</p>
