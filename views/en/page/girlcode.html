          <p>At Q42 we aspire to make the software we build not only useful but also friendly. In fact, we
            want to include literally everyone and make it accessible to all. But, the web, tech in general and
            code specifically, should not only be accessible for all to use, but also accessible for all to build.
              As a company, mainly existing out of developers, we want to make that difference!</p>
            <p>We believe there is plenty of room in the gender gap in tech to make such a difference. After all
            it's called a gap for a reason. Girl Code is our initiative to inspire all women to get into code,
            because we really think the world of code can only benefit from having more women on board
            and creating a more diverse field.</p>
            <p>It's because of this, we organize Girl Code meetups and try to raise more awareness, inside and
            outside our offices, for the gender gap in code.

          <h2>Girl Code at Q42</h2>
          <p>Once upon a time Girl Code had yet to be born. Several Q'ers (both genders) were already
          interested and invested in the issue of the gender gap in code and among our developers. But,
          beyond slack discussions and tweets on our personal accounts, the discussion mainly remained
          within our offices. So when Lieke Boon offered to give a talk about unconscious bias in tech,
          Katja (developer) went to Ineke (PR) and asked: "Can't we make this bigger than just one talk
          Q'ers only?", Ineke replied: "We can and we should!". And so they did. Girl Code was born and
          the first meetup was planned.</p>
          <p>Professional coders arenâ€™t necessarily male. That is what we see as an undeniable fact, but also
          as a statement we want to enforce in the real world. We want no girl to doubt ever again,
          whether or not it is appropriate to be interested in code. And when we say we believe the world
          of code can only benefit from having more women on board and creating a more diverse field,
          we certainly believe that is true for our own working environment too!</p>
          <p>Since last year, the percentage of women at Q has risen from just 6% to now 15%, and we're
          not done! Up for the job? We are always on the lookout for bright minds of all sorts. Whether
          you are a frontender, backender, interaction engineer or 'allender': check our vacancies (Dutch)
          and send us your code!</p>

          <h2>The very first Girl Code meetup</h2>
          <p>Words without action won't change the world. So, to put our money where our mouth is, we've
          organized our first meetup right after we started Girl Code. The result was an inspiring night with
          talks and demos from four professional Girl Coders, a talk by Lieke Boon and a very
            enthusiastic attendance by all sorts of Girl Coders from Girls in Tech's and our own network.</p>
          <p>Successful in their work, we think of our four speakers as role models to girls who play with the
          idea to get into code and being inspirational to girls who already are into code. Boys, of course,
          were welcome too!</p>
