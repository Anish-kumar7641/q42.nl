              <h2>Q42 opens office in Amsterdam</h2>
              <h3>May 3rd 2013</h3>
              <p>It seems like only yesterday that we started building web stuff with three guys and a gold fish in the attic of Kars' mom and dad. Thirteen years later there's 50 of us, we are the Greatest Place to Work and Google Cloud Platform Partner of the Year, and we build wonderful things for the Rijksmuseum, 9292, the Staatsloterij, Philips Hue and much more. And now we've also opened a second office, in Amsterdam.</p>

                <p>In 2004 we built a prize winning website for the Rijksmuseum with our partner Fabrique. But after eight strong years, it was time to renovate.</p>
                <p>The new Rijksmuseum website has been updated with a responsive, tablet first design full of smooth animation. One noteworthy element is the Rijks Studio: your own collection, craft spot and museum store in one. With 125,000 available artworks at a high resolution, you won't be bored any time soon!</p>
