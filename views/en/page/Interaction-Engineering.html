        <div class="intro">
          <p>Interaction engineering is a role Q'ers sometimes take on because we
          believe that some design problems are best solved with a good understanding
          of the underlying engineering.</p>

          <p>In practice, interaction engineers are part of a team. We form a bridge
          between designers and software engineers, improving communication.
          Since we speak the language of both worlds, we can help translate
          and work through challenges that require efforts from both disciplines.</p>

          <p>And because we frequent both worlds, we're also more adept at viewing things
          at a distance. This ability to switch between detail-oriented tasks and high
          level design helps us talk to product stakeholders or clients. We're able to constantly
          re-evaluate decisions, especially as the more technical members
          of the team zoom in on specific engineering challenges.</p>

          <p>Ultimately, understanding the needs of the customer, the end user,
          and the developer puts us in a central role on any team.</p>

          <p>We started doing interaction engineering in 2008. Today, the team consists of
          seven people we're very proud to have: Elaine, Frank, Guido, Johan, Rahul, Richard
          and Roelf-Jan. And other Q'ers regularly jump into the role of the interaction
          engineer when necessary. If you have any questions about interaction engineering, you
          should definitely <a href="/about-q42">get in touch with one of us</a> :-)</p>

          <h2>Engineering with empathy</h2>
          <h3>When just following spec doesn't cut it</h3>

          <p>It turns out that accessibility is actually best seen as an interaction engineering challenge.
            More than just a question of simply implementing the
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a>, making software
            accessible requires knowing how the interface should work for a varied, diverse
            audience. In fact, sometimes web standards aren't the best solution. But
            in order to know how best to tackle the challenge, expertise in both fields is fundamental.</p>

          <p>Because we think accessibility is so important, we've worked to highlight its importance
            with several initiatives.</p>

              object-oriented CSS, and spoke about it at Fronteers 2013.</p>

          <h2>Prototyping interaction in code</h2>
          <h3>Who needs WYSIWYG when you can type it all out by hand?</h3>

          <p>Besides helping out with front end engineering and interaction design, we do
          a lot of prototyping. Iterating on an idea is crucial to revealing the best
          solution, so interaction engineers are especially important
          during a <a href="http://q42.com/jumpstarts">jumpstart</a>
          or during the initial phase of a project when we haven't
          worked out all the details yet.</p>
          <p>That's when our ability to switch quickly
          between design and implementation helps accelerate the team and figure out
          what we should be building in the first place.</p>

          <p>Framer JS and Handcraft are at the top of our list
            because you use code, and we love us some code! But we like Axure,
            Balsamiq Mockups, Proto.io, Construct2, Keynote, Origami, and Sketch
            too. And never leave out good old pen and paper!</p>

            <h2>Handcraft</h2>
            <p>Since 2010 we've had a product that encapsulates our vision of interaction
            engineering called Handcraft. It's a web based HTML prototyping tool made
            for designers who can code. We built it to scratch our own itch, but we're
            happy for anyone else to use it. It's great for early stage iteration on
            an idea, but you can also easily host static websites and mockups with it.</p>

            having to discard too much of the initial work. And with a focus on ease of use and
            making programming accessible to a wide audience, there's a huge overlap with
            our philosophy. So we're huge fans.</p>

          <h2>Designing with motion</h2>
          <h3>Time for some spiffy animations</h3>

          <p>Animation is becoming
            <a href="http://www.google.com/design/spec/animation/authentic-motion.html">more and more important.</a>
            Not just as a way of "spicing up"
            your user experience ("Q-sauce" as we liked to call it back in the day), but as
            a functional element of the user interface that helps communicates transitions or
            context.</p>

          <div class="visual">
            <video controls>
              <source src="http://static.q42.nl/video/ixe/lessonup.webm" type="video/webm" />
              <source src="http://static.q42.nl/video/ixe/lessonup.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
              Video not supported :(
            </video>
          </div>

          <p>And animation is another great example of why interaction engineering
          makes sense: these days, animation is such an important part of the experience
          that you need to iterate on it as you design your app. You can't just do it
          up front. So as far as we're concerned, motion design has become another tool
          in the designer's toolkit.</p>

          <p>We all work with animation, but Richard, a game designer and illustrator, is our
          primary motion engineer. With a healthy obsession for making things bounce and move,
          all at 60 FPS of course, he's upping our game when it comes to creating modern user
          interfaces.</p>

        <aside class="block-small subcontent">
          <h2>Animation tools we like</h2>
          <p>Construct2. Richard swears by it. But also Origami, Framer JS, and plain ol'
          CSS keyframes.</p>
