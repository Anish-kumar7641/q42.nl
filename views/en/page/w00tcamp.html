          <p>Every year we spend two days hacking at w00tcamp. Preliminary to
            w00tcamp we have two pitch rounds where we present each other our
            ideas. During a pitch your audience has to decide if they think an
            idea can and should be built in those two days.</p>
          <p>We also invite some of our friends to join in the w00tcamp fun.
            They need to bring at least one of the following: a brilliant
            idea, fantastic programming or design skills,
            and lots of enthusiasm.</p>
          <p>Over the past few years, a lot of great things have been thought
            out and built. On this page you will find some of them.
            Maybe sometime soon you will encounter one as a real product or
            game. Who knows, maybe you already did!</p>
