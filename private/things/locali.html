  <h2>Locali</h2>
  <p>Towns in the Netherlands have trouble communicating clearly with citizens.
    And citizens often feel unheard. To solve this problem, Hilversum-based
    The Broadcaster asked us to help them put together a platform that brings
    city councils and interested citizens together to work on projects that
    affect everyone.</p>
  <p>So together with <a href="http://oakandmorrow.com">Oak &amp; Morrow</a>,
    we worked out a first MVP in a Jumpstart, which they are now showing to
    interested parties around the country in true lean startup fashion.</p>
  <p>Launching soon!</p>
