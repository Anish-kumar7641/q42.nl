<div class="intro">
  <p>Jumpstarts are our approach to rapid, iterative prototyping. Because
    we believe ideas should be tested as quickly as possible - ideally,
    as you're having them - the jumpstart program allows us to get started
    helping your company through the ideation and experimentation process
    quickly. The focus is on building something real and testable.</p>
  <p>It's also a great opportunity to get to know each other without
    making a big upfront commitment. Focusing on getting something out
    in just a week means we get to face some real challenges and decision-making
    together. That creative pressure, together with working within
    strict constraints, has proven invaluable.</p>
  <p>Jumpstarts usually last one or two weeks. We always build something.
    No endless brainstorming here! And when we feel your product has the
    power to leave a mark, we may invest in it. Take
    a look below for the work we're proudest of*.</p>
