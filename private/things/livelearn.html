  <h2>LiveLearn</h2>
  <p>A jumpstart to explore
  what education could look like if we think beyond books. We built
  this prototype to explore the space between teachers and their students;
  what kind of software can bring out new interactions? How does a classroom
  stand to benefit from technology?</p>
  <p>Today our answer is LessonUp, a bootstrapped startup focused on evolving
    education.</p>
