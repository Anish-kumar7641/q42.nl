  <h2>Auto-restocking platform</h2>
  <p>Together with <a href="http://unitid.nl">UNITiD</a>,
    we tried something new: a <a href="http://www.gv.com/sprint/">design sprint</a>
    immediately followed by a jumpstart. In this case we were working with a
    large Dutch corporation to explore what it would take to create a platform
    that could automatically restock your cupboards.</p>
  <p>But since the project is under wraps, nothing to talk about yet! :)</p>
