  <h2>Game of Drones</h2>
  <p>Bulletproof, armored drones for racing and drone combat.
    Who wouldn't want to be involved?</p>
  <p>We helped Game of Drones build a prototype for
    their drone controller in preparation of demo day at the
    <a href="http://highway1.io">Highway1</a> incubator in San Francisco.
    Turns out, Meteor and iOS are great tools to put something like that
    together within a week!</p>
