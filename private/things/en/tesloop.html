  <h2>Tesloop</h2>
  <p>At a recent Tesla shareholders meeting,
    <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/this-bus-line-uses-teslas-only-was-founded-by-a-16-year-old">a 16 year old stood up and
    asked Elon Musk a question</a>: would he be able to use the upcoming
    driver assistance Autopilot feature in his limo service so that he
    could put customers in the driver's seat?</p>
  <p>The teenager turned out to be one of the co-founders of <a href="http://tesloop.com">Tesloop</a>, a startup
    building a sustainable transport platform that shuttles people between
    Tesla Superchargers in a Model S. We hooked up with them in Los Angeles
    and built the first version of their app that went from nothing to
    in production with Meteor in just four and a half days. The goal? Start booking trips!</p>
