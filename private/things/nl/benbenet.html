  <h2>benbenet</h2>
  <p>Bringing communication and financial services to what is called
    the Bottom of the Pyramid (BoP): the 2.5 billion people on the
    world who live on less than two dollars a day.</p>
  <p>We jumpstarted benbenet's big plan of digital inclusion by
    building an NFC app that's able to text and make payments on- and
    offline through satellites. The resultinged prototype is able to
    do just that and has an intuitive interface even for illiterate
    people. Proof enough for investors to believe benbenet's plan are
    very viable and worth investing in. All that in just one week!</p>
