  <p>It's not enough to have an app that helps you keep track of your
  life goals. It also needs to actually make you happier and more productive.</p>
  <p>That's the goal we set out with on Monday. By Friday, we had something:
    Little Things, the app that helps you remember to spend time with your kids,
    go to the beach, read a book, and do all the other stuff you never seem
    to get around to.</p>
