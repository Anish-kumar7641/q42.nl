  <p>Upgrading cabs to be more like Uber</p>

  <h2>Taxi Electric</h2>
  <p>Build a device into electric cabs driving around Amsterdam that
    streams out positional data and battery charge status to a webserver.
    Make an Android app that receives that data and displays it on a map
    showing where each cab is,
    allowing passengers and drivers to see the status of their trip in
    real time. Build a web application that helps hotel desk clerks
    book trips for customers.</p>
  <p>Do all this in one week. That's a jumpstart!</p>
