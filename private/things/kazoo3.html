  <h2>Kazoo</h2>
  <p>Some of us grew up messing around with sequencers on our computers and
  making our own music. So it was a nice surprise when we were given the
  opportunity to explore how that would work for today's kids.</p>
  <p>We sat down to work on it for a few days, and out came
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wObrMYYp1k8">a web based experimental
  music sequencer</a>. It's even educational!</p>
  <p>Today that experiment lives on as <a href="http://kazoo.nl">Kazoo</a>,
  an educational tool and part of our extensive continuing work with Blink.</p>
