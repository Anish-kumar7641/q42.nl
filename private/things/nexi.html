  <h2>Nexi</h2>
  <p>Plug Nexi into your living room and you're rewarded with a light show
    that indicates how much energy you use in a day. This way you'll know
    when you're using too much at a glance.</p>
  <p>With the app, that we built
    during a Jumpstart at Highway1, you get a sleek and simple setup and
    visualisation that goes beyond a single colour.</p>
