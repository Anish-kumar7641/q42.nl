  <h2>Paper</h2>
  <p>How would a digital, lightweight and digestible magazine fit in a
    time of never-ending feeds and notifications?</p>
  <p>Together with the Dutch newpaper publisher Persgroep we built a
    complete showcase product in one week to experience "Paper". The
    jumpstart greenlit production of the final product that is now
    read by thousands of subscribers on a daily basis.</p>
