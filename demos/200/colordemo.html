<h2>Color Blindness Check</h2>
<h3>Short instructions</h3>
<p>
At the top right you see a small panel. There you can enter the URL of any webpage.
When you click the load button, the page will be loaded and the filter applied.<br />
Please be patient... the filtering could take a few seconds.<br />
You need Internet Explorer 5.0 or up and DirectX for this to work. DirectX should be standard on any modern Windows system.
</p>
<p>
After this you can use the 0%, 70% and 100% radiobuttons to switch between resp. no color-blindness, some color-blindness
and total color-blindness. Please try them for this page.<br />
<br />
Below there's an Ishihara plate commonly used to check for red/green color blindness.<br />
At 0% a number 3 is visible for people with normal color vision.
But at 100% the number 3 is not visible anymore.
